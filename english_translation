			<h2>English Translation</h2>
	<p>Translators: Lynn Ramey and Elisabeth Bloom</p>
	<p>I<br /> [Lady] Pity, the source of my inspiration,<br /> directed me to entertain myself<br /> by speaking of my own life.<br /> It is not right that my mind lessen<br /> because of any evil that destroys my body,<br /> brought on by God.<br /> Because He has sounded the horn for me,<br /> without deceit or villainy<br /> on my part it is appropriate that I ask from each<br /> a gift that none would refuse,<br /> because from here on out I fear I might inconvenience them.</p>
	<p>II<br /> First of all I ask leave<br /> of the person who is closest to me<br /> and whom I must praise the most:<br /> Jehan Boschet, go with God!<br /> I weep night and morning<br /> remembering the goodness that I found in you.<br /> If I cry often in secret,<br /> I have plenty of reasons for that,<br /> from this moment and even more tomorrow.<br /> However, if I do not see you,<br /> my heart sends openly to you<br /> all that remains healthy.</p>
	<p>III<br /> Heart, if you do not turn evil,<br /> neither the uncle nor the nephew<br /> shall be omitted from my missal,<br /> for I have declared myself loyal to them:<br /> Never did I seem an outcast to them,<br /> they always provided for me.<br /> They will surely not be a bit upset to find<br /> that all they gave me is God&rsquo;s:<br /> such gifts are put to extremely good use.<br /> For God did not bring me back<br /> to that which He had destined me,<br /> for which I am both sorrowful and happy.</p>
	<p>IV<br /> Symon d&rsquo;Iser, I brag about you<br /> always, before and after [first and last?],<br /> because all good things are found in you.<br /> Many people see this:<br /> your banner has the motto &ldquo;Go forward,&rdquo;<br /> which raises up those who are beaten down.<br /> Symon, an evil rises in me,<br /> making my whole being its servant<br /> and brings me to bid farewell to you<br /> so painfully that my heart is breaking from it,<br /> because nothing is more painful to me<br /> than to have to say to you &ldquo;God be with you.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>V<br /> Farewell I bid with a broken heart<br /> to those who quenched my thirst<br /> and to Baudoin Zoutemont:<br /> whom I never found to be vexed;<br /> Goodness flourishes in his heart,<br /> sowing the seeds of good deeds.<br /> May God increase his honor and standing!<br /> He makes himself loved by all.<br /> May his soul benefit from this<br /> in the heavenly joy from above,<br /> as well as all those who put up with me<br /> half healthy and half rotten!</p>
	<p>VI<br /> Thibaut de la Pierre in these verses<br /> give me leave, ashamed and hidden<br /> as one abandoned by luck:<br /> This earthly existence has become so awful<br /> that I don&rsquo;t dare go forth except in counter-current.<br /> No amount of poverty bothers me,<br /> all my misfortune I forget and discount,<br /> but my poverty is the humiliation<br /> that is experienced and brought out;<br /> And God, who conquers all things,<br /> considers me a penitent,<br /> because it would be too much for me to live through Hell twice!</p>
	<p>VII<br /> Bretel, whatever happens to me,<br /> it is appropriate for me to withdraw<br /> from the world, where my luck is growing worse,<br /> God does not wish for me to have rest:<br /> Infirmity, both poison and sores,<br /> He has given me to hold my body in contempt.<br /> I must watch out for the worst;<br /> I have anger and sorrow in my heart,<br /> but on the other hand God repays me,<br /> who aspired to serve Him,<br /> for my body is involved in the worst game,<br /> no matter which token I draw.</p>
	<p>VIII<br /> Torment, which descends in my heart<br /> with tortured and pale flesh,<br /> and which makes me become feeble,<br /> before I pack my bags,<br /> tell Wibert de la Sale on my behalf<br /> that I take leave without returning.<br /> Everyday I must, without fail,<br /> think of his noble body,<br /> which has neither blackened bone nor welt,<br /> and for my part come what may,<br /> I can never share the table<br /> with healthy men because I am leprous.</p>
	<p>IX<br /> Vaast Huche Dieu, in all ways<br /> I am your man wherever I may be,<br /> for with you I have never found fault.<br /> Methinks that if I had gone<br /> where I can no longer go,<br /> it would be better to have been in your cohort;<br /> however, I made my own pilgrimage:<br /> God refused me the voyage<br /> that I had well intended to make.<br /> Nonetheless I find He was wise:<br /> he is dead, someone told me,<br /> the Saracen that I hate.</p>
	<p>X<br /> Robert Cosset, with a heavy heart<br /> I commend you and Matthew to God,<br /> for I have made the decision&mdash;<br /> I will avoid you and the others,<br /> for in this world I do not see a place for me,<br /> which makes me play hide-and-seek.<br /> Quickly a man rises up as emir,<br /> and quickly he falls back down as a serf,<br /> wax quickly changed into tallow.<br /> Since I was highest on the wheel<br /> and I placed all my bets,<br /> it is now appropriate that I lose the game.</p>
	<p>XI<br /> Joy, you who aim away from me,<br /> aim toward Beaumetz<br /> and greet for me with a light heart<br /> the lord of the manor with whom<br /> Love agrees, who makes him wise and clever<br /> and of good humor and well-bred.<br /> His whole heart, not at all half,<br /> he has dedicated to courtesy,<br /> and so has left aside villiany.<br /> Reason and pity move him<br /> such that at his expense he introduced me<br /> to that which I must now leave behind.</p>
	<p>XII<br /> Trouble, which blocks my voice and<br /> which was so troublesome and vain,<br /> without any pretense tell Robert Louchart that I said<br /> that joy has withdrawn and flees from me.<br /> From a solid thorn I have become a hollow straw,<br /> but I will have much cause for lamenting<br /> if I remember everything and if I hold on to<br /> the torment that God inflicts me with,<br /> that deafens and blinds me<br /> that no one can equal me<br /> in grief to the point that mine is not greater;<br /> but when one comes it doesn&rsquo;t come alone.</p>
	<p>XIII<br /> Robert Werri, without any doubt<br /> it is appropriate for me to leave the path<br /> and not to see anything again, for which I apologize,<br /> because from me has left all<br /> joy, who has broken the peace with me,<br /> and with all its power accuses me<br /> of the infirmity that I had well hidden.<br /> Along with that, I am lessened and abused by<br /> Shame, which I was so anxious of and feared,<br /> who encouraged inspiration for me<br /> which I myself refuse:<br /> it is better that I leave than that I be thrown out.</p>
	<p>XIV<br /> Trouble, who slays much passion,<br /> who spilt my warm milk,<br /> turn your bridle toward Saint-G&eacute;ry:<br /> greet Wibert of Beaumon and Ansel<br /> on the part of Jean Bodel,<br /> whom God moves from a feather cushion to a straw bed.<br /> tell Lord Mahieu, whom I well love,<br /> that I release my hold on joy,<br /> which I had well enjoyed before Lent.<br /> Now they show me bait and traps,<br /> the people of M&eacute;aulens and of Beaurains,<br /> who are completely spoiled within.</p>
	<p>XV<br /> Henry the Black, I&rsquo;ve made peace with you<br /> in case I did you any wrong<br /> before following the path that has been shown me;<br /> I reached the pits of despair<br /> the day I received a blow that cannot be taken back.<br /> I could not save myself.<br /> You have always spun the top for me,<br /> and since then I have never had any joy,<br /> I&rsquo;ve only known pain, torment, deprivation<br /> and an illness at war with me;<br /> however I would be wrong to blame you for what has happened to me<br /> because God has had his eye on me for a long time.</p>
	<p>XVI<br /> Torment, you who cripple me and make me sorrowful,<br /> go and find Baude Guistrenave.<br /> Ask him to give me approval to leave,<br /> because I am preparing myself to enter an army<br /> from which no one emerges in good health,<br /> beware the food without change,<br /> and since Reason asks me<br /> to lead a life of penitence<br /> and things are heading downhill,<br /> I ask the God who sacrificed himself<br /> to help me endure a torment long enough, so<br /> that in the shadows He makes light.</p>
	<p>XVII<br /> Distress, I beg her, she who pilots my ship,<br /> to tell the detailed story to the castellan<br /> and to Baudouin, his son, in person<br /> about how God, according to His will, punishes me.<br /> I flower when winter comes,<br /> and when summer comes I am covered in frost.<br /> Thus in other times I green.<br /> But God has played a trick on me so strange<br /> that all the doctors in Salerno<br /> would not be able to lessen the pain I endure.<br /> I&rsquo;ve been forgotten on the field like offering-wheat.<br /> It&rsquo;s a wheat that sprouts easily.</p>
	<p>XVIII<br /> Jacques Audent, whatever my fate may be,<br /> I must abandon the group.<br /> Hesitation is no longer possible.<br /> Often you have helped me push my cart<br /> before the evil for which I am condemned<br /> took your company from me.<br /> From now on, I no longer count on any pity<br /> to lessen my misery,<br /> nor any divine intervention<br /> to lessen my pain.<br /> May God inflict on my body the punishment<br /> that will liberate my soul from its debt.</p>
	<p>XIX<br /> Distress, you who slide into my heart,<br /> go in my place where I send you,<br /> for I don&rsquo;t dare go any further.<br /> Say goodbye for me to Pierre Wasquet.<br /> He has done much for me, for me he promises<br /> to do even more in the future.<br /> The merchants have been a great strength to me,<br /> he and Simon Durand,<br /> let them know about my situation<br /> for they have never failed<br /> to do well by me all their lives.<br /> I commend them to God Himself.</p>
	<p>XX<br /> Raoul Ravuin, mayor? with a big heart,<br /> in these circumstances one can be charitable<br /> toward me, a member of your guild.<br /> I have nothing more to do in this world,<br /> rather I should withdraw from it.<br /> However, when I was there,<br /> I found fathers and mothers everywhere.<br /> It is right that I pay the price today,<br /> but I must accept with good will<br /> a difficult and bitter life for my body<br /> in order to render my soul clean and pure.<br /> one must regenerate one&rsquo;s body.</p>
	<p>XXI<br /> Garin, because such is my destiny,<br /> I must not leave without your permission<br /> and I don&rsquo;t wish to do so:<br /> my friend, I commend you to God.<br /> My presence is contested and refused<br /> by the society that I have never ceased to love so,<br /> it no longer wishes to welcome me,<br /> I always imagined that in another path<br /> I would be far from this country,<br /> but I am not permitted to cross the threshold.<br /> However I praise God and obey him willingly<br /> in order to prolong my period of sacrifice.</p>
	<p>XXII<br /> Heart, go to the home of Baudouin,<br /> that great tournament champion.<br /> He never ceases to act as a man of honor.<br /> May God give him the joy of which I have little,<br /> the health which I lack,<br /> and the advantages that He passes under my nose.<br /> It will be great wealth for him, because in me<br /> there is a mass and concentration<br /> of all the suffering that extinguishes joy.<br /> God made me fall into the depths,<br /> I suffer from an evil from which no ones escapes<br /> when it has struck the target with its strength.</p>
	<p>XXIII<br /> B&eacute;rard, it is not right even if I am allowed to do so<br /> that I leave without your permission<br /> to live my Holy Week.<br /> I know so well your delicate nature<br /> that, I know it well, you are saddened<br /> to have heard he sing my last song.<br /> But if, not without difficulty, one can put out<br /> from a sick body a healthy word<br /> then it is right that I do not silence my thoughts.<br /> Here is the spring ready to bubble forth:<br /> my heart and the evil that dominates me<br /> are not of the same nature.</p>
	<p>XXIV<br /> Distress, you who taught me the contents of your book,<br /> deliver to Baude Boulard my message:<br /> tell him that may God keep him safe,<br /> and that Shame and Torment make me lose my head<br /> as they attack me night and day.<br /> They have warned me and strongly let me know<br /> that, even if I suffer from the lack of a friend,<br /> I must not seek the company of any of them&mdash;<br /> they have been bothered enough.<br /> I must congratulate myself, even one must hate it,<br /> that God has marked me with the seal<br /> of a death from which can come a new life.</p>
	<p>XXV<br /> Distress, you alone who have tamed me,<br /> count among my good friends<br /> Martin Verdi&egrave;re who lives outside these walls.<br /> He walks on the good path.<br /> Don&rsquo;t forget, either, Bertrand,<br /> because he has promised me a treasure.<br /> Neither he nor Mahieu le Fort will ever<br /> be left out of what I write,<br /> no matter how unseated I may be.<br /> But in order to face God, no spell has power<br /> since He has taken my body from me.<br /> I give to Him, as is correct, my soul.</p>
	<p>XXVI<br /> Torment, you who grow and fill my heart,<br /> say hello from me to Joffroi the doctor.<br /> because I must say leave him.<br /> I am his vassal and he my lord.<br /> I have had the chance to experience his skill,<br /> no one could teach him more than he knows.<br /> He went to much trouble<br /> to seal and sew up my flesh,<br /> this substance that has become so fragile.<br /> How did he dare to undertake the task<br /> of repairing and cutting a head<br /> so completely in bad shape!</p>
	<p>XXVII<br /> Torment, you who have destroyed my joy,<br /> pay Aliaume Pi&eacute;dargent for me.<br /> Go and give him my regards one more time:<br /> I must take flight<br /> and abandon all the joys<br /> that have until now been my nourishment.<br /> But this misery spreads gold over me,<br /> for I know well that God heals<br /> him that, as a grace, accepts such a battle.<br /> Without waiting, I want to make my spirit bloom,<br /> open my heart and close my eyes,<br /> since for me day breaks when night falls.</p>
	<p>XXVIII<br /> Baudouin Fastoul, here I am before justice:<br /> an unpleasant matter that makes me ashamed<br /> has disrupted my situation.<br /> Joy, which declared war on me,<br /> spared me no credit,<br /> but demanded double from me.<br /> It sold me its favors at an expensive price,<br /> yet I see an advantage in the damage<br /> that harms me here, if it serves me elsewhere:<br /> I feel soothed by the beautiful hope<br /> of great inalienable joy<br /> where each of us has what we wish for.</p>
	<p>XXIX<br /> Distress, go there where I do not go,<br /> to bid farewell to the Pi&eacute;dargents:<br /> the more I love them, the more I avoid them.<br /> Simon, may the God in whom you believe<br /> make you wear your cross<br /> there where I cannot wear mine!<br /> By not leaving the suburbs,<br /> I have granted the pagans a long-lasting truce;<br /> but if God had been magnanimous,<br /> He would not have failed to provide me with assistance,<br /> to the extent that on earth, which was previously his,<br /> I would have written a serventois of the Crusade.</p>
	<p>XXX<br /> In my sorrow, my shame and my weariness,<br /> I place in God&rsquo;s care Baude and Thomas<br /> whose usual conduct I greatly appreciate.<br /> God, source of all commodities,<br /> You who flogged me with your rod,<br /> give them the strength and the power<br /> to retain the purity of their youth!<br /> I could have been sure of their help<br /> if I had been able to go to Damascus,<br /> but I stayed, and I know why:<br /> upon the dice, God counted all my pips ,<br /> yet he made me roll two aces .<br /> XXXI<br /> Distress, which spreads within me,<br /> which enfeebles me and knocks me down,<br /> exhorts me day and night<br /> to contradict myself and to turn away from the world,<br /> along with Shame, which too has accompanied me<br /> and escorted me for a long time:<br /> there where joy reigns,<br /> there is no more available space for me;<br /> but, already on the way, I take my leave<br /> of him whose alias eludes me,<br /> for the distance is great, I believe,<br /> between Jean Sadness and G&eacute;rard Joy.</p>
	<p>XXXII<br /> With your leave, Waubert le Clerc,<br /> I go suffering from a terrible pain,<br /> God protects all my friends from it!<br /> You have been sincere and loyal to me,<br /> you never closed your door on me<br /> each time that I wanted to share your meal:<br /> may God reward you generously<br /> and take revenge on me<br /> in such a manner that his door will be open to me!<br /> He has chosen the way to make me atone for my sins<br /> without leaving my body any hope of recovery,<br /> for I have been stacked too green .</p>
	<p>XXXIII<br /> I am prepared to leave,<br /> but even so, I must not carry the bale along :<br /> I made the decision to bid farewell.<br /> G&eacute;rard d&rsquo;Espagne, they are still brand new<br /> your gifts of old, and here is the proof:<br /> they regain life through my death;<br /> all that I have been given for my pleasure,<br /> provided that everything is a sign of kindness, comes back to life.<br /> Close to God, for you, I make the most of your acts of generosity<br /> so that He will return them to your soul:<br /> I do not have a worthier offering to present you<br /> as a New Year&rsquo;s gift.</p>
	<p>XXXIV<br /> I place in God&rsquo;s care the Monnoier:<br /> May God grant him<br /> the possibility of continuing his journey,<br /> for, if he does not lose his bearings in straying from the path,<br /> he starts to blossom!<br /> May God make him hold his hand steady!<br /> He has gained momentum;<br /> as he loves and ardently desires honor,<br /> May God permit him to follow the route that he has chosen,<br /> him, as well as all those<br /> who will contribute to paying my pension:<br /> My biggest fear is inconveniencing the world!</p>
	<p>XXXV<br /> Ah! Master Renaut de Beauvois,<br /> the world is certainly very bad!<br /> So behave as well as you say you do,<br /> you have borne your burden for a very long time.<br /> I have gone; if you left as well,<br /> silence would weigh upon Arras.<br /> Of beautiful tales and of beautiful words,<br /> the city did indeed resound so much<br /> that never again will such strains be heard.<br /> I declare this to you without flattering or attempting to deceive you,<br /> you contradict all those who squint:<br /> your words are wise but your actions mad.</p>
	<p>XXXVI<br /> Caignet, I pity you greatly for being destined<br /> to live eternally in need.<br /> Let&rsquo;s go, regain vigor, come to life!<br /> Comport yourself as a man of good and of honor:<br /> wear my cross, and you will have two;<br /> for, if you found yourself far from the region,<br /> you would quickly be shielded from misfortune,<br /> in Barletta or in Brindisi.<br /> Here, you cannot be happy,<br /> get going, excuse my absence:<br /> if you are over there miserable in my place,<br /> I will be here unhappy in your place.</p>
	<p>XXXVII<br /> Ah! Nicolas le Charpentier,<br /> my generous and faithful companion,<br /> farewell, here I am ready for departure!<br /> With affectionate goodwill,<br /> as if you were in my debt,<br /> you have shown yourself to be available when I needed it .<br /> At present, there is no longer any other solution:<br /> you will go capture the top prize<br /> there where I am blocked from the path.<br /> God recognizes the good pilgrim:<br /> may He provide my soul with assistance,<br /> for my body is already placed on the trestles!<br /> XXXVIII<br /> Distress, give my regards to<br /> Robert Audent, he himself and Bernard,<br /> for they have always shown themselves to be at once<br /> full of consideration for and attentiveness to me;<br /> but my heart is very close to splitting;<br /> the twofold thought that assails me<br /> nourishes in my heart joy and grief;<br /> I laugh and I sigh, I sing and I cry.<br /> I feel absolutely<br /> that I have at once the upper and the lower hand:<br /> my body passes away, my soul remains;<br /> thus I remain, I pass away.</p>
	<p>XXXIX<br /> Distress, you who abound in my heart,<br /> give my regards, in all directions, to<br /> Arras and to all the people of the commune,<br /> for they are filled with blessing and honor,<br /> but more than any woman in the world,<br /> I insist that you give my regards to one,<br /> the wife of the lawyer of B&eacute;thune.<br /> I do not know of a person more courteous:<br /> it is the lady of Tenremonde.<br /> May God who gave her life under the new moon<br /> give her some desire<br /> to continue spreading her kindness over me!</p>
	<p>XL<br /> Distress, you who burn me with your fire<br /> &ndash; I do not know which other messenger to choose &ndash;<br /> take to the mayor of Arras this brief<br /> and be vigilant that it be read before him:<br /> if it is God&rsquo;s will, and if his nobleness of heart invites him to do so,<br /> he will not cause me to lose my fief.<br /> Have him also read<br /> to the county magistrates, from one end to the other,<br /> so that they may be seized with pity,<br /> for, if I live in agony and misfortune,<br /> it is right that they share my suffering:<br /> it is in their service that I developed this pain.</p>
	<p>XLI<br /> My friends, before going,<br /> I beseech you, in my twilight years,<br /> by Christ and his Nativity,<br /> to collect among yourselves a contribution<br /> to bring to an end the fight that gives itself up<br /> and that must leave no one indifferent:<br /> it would be a noble donation that you would have made me<br /> if I found myself brought to M&eacute;aulens with your help.<br /> I do not know a dwelling that suits me better,<br /> the place has pleased me for a long time,<br /> for charitable people are found there,<br /> and I could eat my fill there.</p>
	<p>XLII<br /> Lady, you who are God&rsquo;s mother and child,<br /> make not broken<br /> my heart, whatever misfortune may descend upon me,<br /> for I am absolutely certain<br /> that the only way I can hope to profit<br /> is to adopt the behavior<br /> that will make me remain at your service.<br /> May you accept that it be so for me<br /> and that care always be taken<br /> by my heart, whatever becomes of my body,<br /> to constantly remember<br /> hell and heaven.</p>
	<p>XLIII<br /> Lady, repository of all virtues,<br /> I take my leave of the Sainte Chandelle<br /> that you gave to the minstrels;<br /> I have ceased placing my lips upon it<br /> due to a pain that has affected me<br /> and that compels me to follow the winding paths.<br /> Never again will I find refuge by going near it,<br /> but I will leave with it my eternal love,<br /> and when I am at Petit-March&eacute;,<br /> I will kiss the tower<br /> where it is laid,<br /> and thus I will have less misery in my heart.</p>
	<p>XLIV<br /> Ah! Troubadours, dear companions,<br /> to me you have been the good friends<br /> that very loyal confr&egrave;res must be:<br /> in seeking to secure my subsistence<br /> you have shown me your friendship and given me satisfaction<br /> more so than if you had all been my brothers.<br /> May God reward you for it,<br /> Him and his very gentle, beloved mother<br /> who has granted you the sublime gift!<br /> Ask her to reveal her generosity<br /> to me and to intercede with her father<br /> and of her son, so that I may obtain pardon for my sins.</p>
	<p>XLV<br /> I am eager to place you in God&rsquo;s care<br /> all together, without naming each one,<br /> for I have no complaints about anyone,<br /> on the contrary, I am greatly pleased with you and I should be pleased.<br /> I must leave you,<br /> however heavy my heart may be:<br /> it is rather an unpleasant company<br /> that I must join.<br /> May God now grant me the grace to bear<br /> the pain that mutilates my body,<br /> so that, knowingly accepting it, I may succeed<br /> in offering Him my soul.</p>
